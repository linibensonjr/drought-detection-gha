# drought-detection-gha
A repository for my thesis on developing a drought index. This project aims to create a multivariate drought index using terrestrial water storage (TWS), precipitation and soil moisture (SM). The repository includes code for calculating and visualizing drought indices, as well as tools for data preprocessing and  evaluation.
